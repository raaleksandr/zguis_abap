# zguis_abap

Started my new project - Library to use SAPGUI Scripting in ABAP in convenient way
Currently in development

For now SAP GUI Scripting Controls Viewer is ready.
You can see all SAP GUI Scripting object model controls with properties in a tree-like representation.
This program will help to write own scripts on ABAP in the future and scripts on VBA already now.

How it works:
 1. Go to SE38
 2. Run the program ZGUIS_EXPLORER
 3. ALV Grid with sessions opens where you can double click neede session.
    Note that one session is one SAPGUI window currently open.
 4. After choosing a session you drill down to a tree where you can explore all SAP GUI Scripting objects with properties starting from Session object.
